Trees Introduction -->

-- A tree is a type of data structure used to represent hierarchical relationships. It consists of nodes, where
each node contains a value and may have one or more child nodes connected to it. The topmost node in a tree
is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves. Each node, except the root, has exactly one
parent. Trees are often used to model structures such as file systems, organization charts, or the structure of
a website.

-- One common type of tree is the binary tree, where each node can have at most two children, typically referred
to as the left and right child. Variations like binary search trees, AVL trees, and heaps add rules to organize
or balance the tree, making them efficient for specific operations like searching, inserting, or deleting data.

-- Trees are an essential concept in computer science because they allow efficient data storage, retrieval, and
manipulation, especially when the relationships between data elements are naturally hierarchical.
